# Personal Statement
As a young scientist, I aim to develop better tools for diagnosing and treating children with developmental disorders like autism. My aim requires extensive informatics and clinical training, I have studied developmental and aging disorders, functional and structural primate brain organization using MRI; I have also studied visual perception and social behavior using psychophysical tasks and observed behavior. Because of my research over the past decade, I am an expert in MRI, psychophysical, animal behavioral, and social network analysis techniques, and have studied autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and the development of rhesus macaques. 

# Positions
From 2001-2007, I studied structural and functional MRI from Nouchine Hadjkahni, Gordon Harris, Christopher Wright, and Bradford Dickerson. In 2005, I received my B.A. in neuroscience from Brandeis University. From 2007-2013. I pursued and obtained my Ph.D. in neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis, where I mastered network analysis, resting state functional MRI, and studied autism spectrum disorders. As a postdoc at Emory University from 2013-2016, I studied rhesus macaque visual and social development with Lisa Parr, Mar Sanchez, and Jocelyne Bachevalier. Since arriving at Oregon Health and Sciences University in 2016, I received a position on the National Library of Medicine postdoctoral fellowship, and pivoted towards data science and informatics. In my latest work, I developed an approach to characterize heterogeneity of clinical outcomes.
